# Launch-Sites-Locations-Analysis-with-Folium

The launch success rate may depend on many factors such as payload mass, orbit type, and so on. It may also depend on the location and proximities of a launch site, i.e., the initial position of rocket trajectories. Finding an optimal location for building a launch site certainly involves many factors and hopefully we could discover some of the factors by analyzing the existing launch site locations.
